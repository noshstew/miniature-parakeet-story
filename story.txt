Once upon a time in a land not so far away lived a college student. They had no name, as they were just a template the reader can relate to.
They were as relatable as could be. Their time was mostly spent procrastinating doing their comp sci 400 assignments, such as x3. In fact, they didn't even start working on it until 2 hours before the deadline.
